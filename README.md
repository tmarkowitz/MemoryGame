## Reflection Questions
1. If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here. 
[I used stackoverflow once to help me figure out how to change the text on a button using javascript]

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words) 
[I didn't encounter many challenges in my submission, however, the part that was unfamiliar to me was implenting css. I had used javascript and html 
to make a website in a highschool class before but I never learned how to alter it cosmetically. The guide was very useful to help me learn it hands on,
which is my favorite way to learn.]

3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
[Now that I know how to make a website, a big question I have is how do I publicize it? Is the only way to pay for a website to host it?
How do domain names work? How would I monitize my website?]

4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
[If I had a few more hours to work on this project I would add another layer to the game to make it more difficult. Perhaps I would keep the colors and sounds of the 4 boxes the same, but
whenever the player succesfully gets through a round with the right guess, I would randomize the order that the boxes are displayed.]
